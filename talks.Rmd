## R and Power BI - Better Together
**2018-03-08 / Jacksonville Power BI User Group / [URL](https://www.meetup.com/Jacksonville-Power-BI-User-Group-PUG/events/247568258/)**

R is one of the leading languages in the world of data science. It has a growing following and many applications, including data transformation, machine learning, statistical modeling, data visualization, web applications, and even building websites.

R is widely used in academia, science and business. Some of the large companies like Microsoft, Facebook, Airbnb, Etsy, Stitch Fix, IBM and Uber use R for data science exclusively, or in tandem with Python.

In this session, we will first look at R separately as a language, followed by use of R within Power BI: how, when and why to resort to it for data transformation, modeling and visualization.
