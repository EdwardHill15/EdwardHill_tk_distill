![](static/photo_tc.jpg)

My name is __Taras Kaduk__ _(Ukrainian🇺🇦: Тарас Кадук)_, and this is my website. I write about geospatial data analytics (as well as data science in general), mostly in the context of R language. On this site, you can find my posts and projects, as well as the list of recently given talks.

I have a full-time job _(I will most likely forget to update this page if and when I change positions, but my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taraskaduk) is always up to date)_, but this blog is my personal endeavor, worked on and updated in my spare time.

I am very passionate about data science in general, and the use of R language within the data science context. I love thinking about geographic and geospatial problems, from borders, to urban planning, to transportation.

I'm pretty active on Twitter under the username [taraskaduk](https://twitter.com/taraskaduk). I live in Jacksonville, FL.
