I write about geospatial data analytics (as well as data science in general), mostly in the context of R language. On this site, you can find my posts and projects, as well as the list of recently given talks.\nI have a full-time job (I will most likely forget to update this page if and when I change positions, but my LinkedIn page is always up to date), but this blog is my personal endeavor, worked on and updated in my spare time.\nI am very passionate about data science in general, and the use of R language within the data science context. I love thinking about geographic and geospatial problems, from borders, to urban planning, to transportation.\nI‚Äôm pretty active on Twitter under the username taraskaduk. I live in Jacksonville, FL.\n\n\n\n",
