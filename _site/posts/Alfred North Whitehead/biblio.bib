Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {At first glance, C. G. Jung and Alfred North Whitehead might seem to have little in common. On the one hand, Jung spent the formative years of his early career working as a psychiatrist in a mental institution, during which time he began his eight-year association with Freud, which resulted in Jung playing a large, and often unacknowledged, role in the early promulgation of psychoanalysis. Over the half-century following his break with Freud, Jung built his own approach to depth psychology that engaged primarily with the psychological reality of fantasy images, myths, and dreams. On the other hand, Whitehead had a full career as an influential mathematician, writing the seminal book on modern mathematics, Principia Mathematica, near the beginning of the twentieth century with his student Bertrand Russell. In his sixties, Whitehead made the shift to philosophy, specifically metaphysical cosmology, though he always retained the rigorous and abstract approach characteristic of mathematics, a level of precision that philosophers have often sought to emulate. Thus, on the surface, it would seem that Jung's engagement with psyche and Whitehead's engagement with cosmos have virtually nothing in common. However, as this implicit reference to Richard Tarnas's Cosmos and Psyche indicates, the deepest intimations of their psychology and cosmology, respectively, seem to suggest a convergence of these two thinkers' projects. Indeed, as I have read their work over the years, I have increasingly come to see profound connections between their ideas, particularly between Jung's concept of archetypes,},

abstract = {The unconscious is the residue of unconquered nature in us, just as it is also the matrix of our unborn future. (Jung, Psychological Types {\S}907) Introduction Our approach to Rational Intuition reflects the shared purpose of other chapters in this volume: to explore and articulate the relationship between rationality and intuition. Both Carl Gustav Jung and Alfred North Whitehead were conversant with the history of these terms. In Jung's view, thinking and feeling are aspects of what he called the “rational functions,” while intuition and sensation are aspects of the nonrational, or what he called the “irrational functions” of the psyche – where psyche refers to “the totality of all psychic processes, conscious as well as unconscious” (Jung, 1921, p.463 {\S}797). Whitehead's philosophy emphasized feeling over the other functions. In their discussion of traditional mental functions, both followed the general direction laid out by Aristotle and the epistemological traditions that grew out of his writings on logic and rhetoric. However, each introduced innovations in order to address specific philosophical issues of interest to them. Terms such as intuition, sensation, feeling, and thinking have a very long history in both common language and the technical discourse of philosophy. A comparison of Jung and Whitehead on the issue of rational intuition in the span of a single chapter is challenging, given the divergence of their original and sometimes idiosyncratic use of terms. Looking beyond obvious differences, certain features of their intellectual stance reveal agreement in spirit: both delighted in openly exploring a given topic in the course of explaining it; their thoughts often recurred to the unresolved complexities they have created in framing the topic; and both were unrelentingly empirical. Both men were concerned about the polarities generated by the European Enlightenment, both strove to heal the bifurcation of human life into mental and physical realms.},

Whitehead's model is developed in ways he could not have anticipated to show how it can advance current debates beyond well-known sticking points. This has trenchant consequences for epistemology and suggests fresh and promising new perspectives on such topics as the mind-body problem, the neurobiology of consciousness, animal consciousness, the evolution of consciousness, panpsychism, the unity of consciousness, epiphenomenalism, free will, and causation.},

@book{Skrbina2017,
abstract = {In Panpsychism in the West, the first comprehensive study of the subject, David Skrbina argues for the importance of panpsychism -- the theory that mind exists, in some form, in all living and nonliving things -- in consideration of the nature of consciousness and mind. Panpsychism, with its conception of mind as a general phenomenon of nature, uniquely links being and mind. More than a theory of mind, it is a meta-theory -- a statement about theories of mind rather than a theory in itself. Panpsychism can parallel almost every current theory of mind; it simply holds that, no matter how one conceives of mind, such mind applies to all things. After a brief discussion of general issues surrounding philosophy of mind, Skrbina examines the panpsychist views of philosophers from the pre-Socratics to the post-structuralists. The original edition of Panpsychism in the West helped to reinvigorate a neglected and important aspect of philosophic thinking. This revised edition offers expanded and updated material that reflects the growth of panpsychism as a subdiscipline. It covers the problem of emergence of mind from a non-mental reality and the combination problem in greater detail. It offers expanded coverage of the pre-Socratics and Plato; a new section on Augustine; expanded discussions of Continental panpsychism, scientific arguments, Nietzsche, and Whitehead; and a new section on Russellian monism. With this edition, Panpsychism in the West will be continue to be the standard work on the topic.},
