	abstract = {Background
Prior studies that examined the association between temperature and mortality relied on mean temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, humidex, and daily temperature variability, not accounting for variations in hourly temperature throughout the day. We proposed an indicator, excess degree-hours, to examine the association between temperature and mortality.
Methods
A distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was used to determine the hot (27.8 °C) and cold (24.3 °C) threshold. Hourly temperature in Guangzhou, China were summarized with extreme heat expressed as sum of degree-hours {\textgreater}27.8 °C and extreme cold as sum of degree-hours {\textless}24.3 °C within one day from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2015. We then estimated the associations of daily mortality with hot and cold degree-hours in both hot and cold season. We also calculated the mortality burden of excess degree-hours.
Results
An interquartile range (IQR) increase of hot degree-hours was associated with 2.11\% (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI]: 1.25\%, 2.98\%), 3.74\% (95\% CI: 0.71\%, 6.86\%), and 2.63\% (95\% CI: 0.70\%, 4.59\%) increments in non-injury related death, respiratory mortality, and cardiovascular mortality, respectively. While the corresponding excess risk for an IQR increase of cold degree-hours was 2.42\% (95\% CI: 1.97\%, 2.88\%), 3.16\% (95\% CI: 2.57\%, 3.76\%), and 2.93\% (95\% CI: 1.98\%, 3.88\%). The estimated mortality burdens for hot and cold degree-hours were 1366,2465, respectively.
Conclusion
The excess degree-hours reduced to a single indication in duration and intensity is an approach and shows a different perspective and significant extreme weather effects on human health.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Forensic anthropologists often rely on the state of decomposition to estimate the postmortem interval (PMI) in a human remains case. The state of decomposition can provide much information about the PMI, especially when decomposition is treated as a semi-continuous variable and used in conjunction with accumulated-degree-days (ADD). This preliminary study demonstrates a supplemental method of determining the PMI based on scoring decomposition using a point-based system and taking into account temperatures in which the remains were exposed. This project was designed to examine the ways that forensic anthropologists could improve their PMI estimates based on decomposition by using a more quantitative approach. A total of 68 human remains cases with a known date of death were scored for decomposition and a regression equation was calculated to predict ADD from decomposition score. ADD accounts for approximately 80\% of the variation in decomposition. This study indicates that decomposition is best modeled as dependent on accumulated temperature, not just time.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
